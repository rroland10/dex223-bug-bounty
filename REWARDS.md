# Dex223 Bug Bounty Rewards

## Reward Structure Overview

The Dex223 Bug Bounty Program offers competitive rewards in D223 tokens for security vulnerabilities found in our platform. Rewards are determined based on severity and impact. Our program is designed to attract top-tier security researchers while maintaining sustainable reward levels.

## Reward Tiers

### Critical Severity (30M D223)

**Description**: A vulnerability that can completely break the contracts workflow

**Examples:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) on production systems
- Complete compromise of user funds or private keys
- Smart contract vulnerabilities leading to fund theft
- Authentication bypass with admin privileges
- Critical infrastructure compromise

### High Severity (7M D223)

**Description**: A bug report that indicates a high severity problem but can't impact the whole platform

**Examples:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- SQL injection with data access
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) with session hijacking
- Smart contract logic flaws
- Privilege escalation

### Medium Severity (3M D223)

**Description**: A low-severity problem that can lead to a loss of funds but under specific conditions

**Examples:**
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure direct object references
- Weak encryption implementation
- Business logic flaws

### Informational (1M D223)

**Description**: Anything else - best practices, documentation improvements, etc.

**Examples:**
- Documentation improvements
- Security recommendations
- Code quality suggestions
- Performance optimizations
- Educational content
